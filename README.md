Just a quick mockup to showcase my layout design skills

How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML and CSS

I simply looked at the website layout, used color picker to get the exact hex color code created sections, inserted images, and created a navigation header and navigation footer

Optimizations


My footer is a bit off due to time constraints and my header could be better centered. I would love to add JavaScript to this as well.

Lessons Learned:
Simplicity is key.
